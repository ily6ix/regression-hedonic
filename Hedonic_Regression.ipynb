    "\n",
    "A **hedonic regression** estimates the price of a product (like a house) by evaluating the contribution of its individual features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, it is represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "House Price = β₀ + β₁*(Size) + β₂*(Bedrooms) + β₃*(Distance) + ε\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- **β₀ (Intercept)** = base price of the house\n",
    "- **β₁, β₂, β₃** = effect of each feature on price\n",
    "- **ε** = error term (difference between predicted and actual prices)\n",
    "\n",
    "This model helps answer questions like:\n",
    "- How much does an extra bedroom add to the price?\n",
    "- How much does distance from the city reduce the price?\n"
